I had only around 15h for this game exercise. 
The game itself is really similar to pokemon if you compare the logic behind it. Its obviously smaller and simpler. 

You can run around in the spooky house and find different rooms.

In some rooms are enemys which you can take with "Space".

Then you you 4 options and have a fight against the bat. Your attacks, but also the bat in general are having special animations.
